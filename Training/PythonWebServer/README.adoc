= Python Web Server Training

This training involves creating a simple web server that presents information from an external location.

.Example

This training aims to provide experience with the following:

* Python, CSS, HTML, and Javascript
* Creating a web server
* AJAX calls
* Using a docker environment
* Submitting a pull request for review


== Running the Boiler Plate

The boiler plate runs on Python3, but it is recommended to run this program in Docker.
Steps to install Docker are link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[here]
On Windows operating systems less than Windows 10 Pro, you will need to use link:https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/[Docker Toolbox] instead of the default Docker installation.

Follow these steps to run the program.

. Verify that Docker is properly installed with `docker run hello-world`.

. Then build the Docker image with `./docker-build.sh init`, you will only need to run this when the `Dockerfile` changes.

. Then run the program with `./docker-build.sh run 8000`, with the last argument being whatever port you wish to run on.

. You can then connect to the webserver on your web browser at http://localhost:8000
If you are using Docker Toolbox, connect at http://192.168.99.100:8000
Change the port number to whatever port you chose in the `./docker-build.sh run <port>` command.
You should see a red "Hello world!" at the center of the browser.

== List of Changes To Complete

. Create a UI that looks similar to the example.
Do not worry making an exact copy, the important parts are:
.. Gradient background that covers the whole window
.. Responsive button
.. Clearly separated information sections
.. General spacing separating various elements

. Ensure the different sections are responsive to the window size.

. Update the `Dockerfile` to install the `psutil` Python package.

. Have the server respond to a POST request with the following information using `psutil`:
.. The current time (does not use `psutil`)
.. The amount of CPUs (logical processors) and the system-wide CPU utilization as a percentage
.. The amount of total and used RAM in GB to two decimal places

. Send an AJAX request when the _Update_ button is pressed and update the page with the results.
